Lately, I’ve been spending a lot of time on LeetCode.

In software development, there are so many exciting aspects — exploring new technologies, improving performance, solving real-world problems, and building things that people actually use. But when it comes to landing a job as a software engineer, one thing stands out as especially important: data structures and algorithms.

I’ve realized that problem-solving is an area where I still have a lot of room to grow. Working through coding challenges has been both humbling and motivating, and I’m making it a priority to strengthen these skills.

##### TL;DR: LeetCode may not be everything in software engineering, but right now,  LeetCode is my new religion.

I'll start grinding AWS SAA weekly from September, and the plan is to crush the exam early next year.(hopefully...)   

Why? It's because cloud computing has become such an important part of modern software development, and AWS is at the center of it. 

I want to deepen my understanding of designing scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient systems(skills that I believe are essential for any software engineer today).
